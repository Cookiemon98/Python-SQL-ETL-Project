# Python-SQL-ETL-Project
Welcome to this ETL project done using Python and SQL.

## Overview
This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built using Python and SQL. It extracts raw data from multiple sources, performs transformations such as cleaning, standardization, and aggregation in Python, and loads the processed data into a structured database for analysis and reporting. The workflow is designed to be scalable, modular, and efficient, making it easy to adapt to different datasets and business use cases.
