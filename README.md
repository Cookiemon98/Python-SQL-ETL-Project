# Python-SQL-ETL-Project
Welcome to this ETL project done using Python and SQL.

## Overview
This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built using Python and SQL. It extracts raw data from Kaggle using API and performs the first set of transformations in Python. The half-processed data is then loaded into a structured database, and further transformations, such as cleaning, standardization, and aggregation, are done using SQL for analysis and reporting.
